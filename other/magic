Let's define a blast to be a sequence B of N integers generated by the following formula, by taking three integers: x, y, and z.

B[0] = x
B[i] = (B[i - 1] * y + x) % z for 1 <= i <= N

Let the sorted version of such a sequence be called a cool blast C;

and our function f(E, F, N) to be the following

ret = 0
for i = 0 -> N - 1
	ret = (ret * E + C[i]) % F
return ret

Given the integers x, y, z, N, and H. output the cool blast after passing each of its elements to the function.

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 <= T <= 30).
For each test case the input is as follows:
	One line containing N (1 <= N <= 10e6)
	One line containing x, y, and z (1 <= x, y, z <= 10e9)
	One line containing E, and F (1 <= E, F, <= 10e9)
